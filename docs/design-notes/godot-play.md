# Godot: one app with Editor and Play, and Open in Godot

Code: `src-tauri/src/godot/` (`detect`, `runner`, `addon`, `scene`, `rpc`, `live`), one entry
(`godot::rpc::godot`) routed from `apps/godot_viewer.rs` for the Godot app's id, `godot-viewer`,
and its `play` alias. Frontend: `apps/godot-viewer/ui`, where `App.tsx` is the mode shell,
`SceneMode.tsx` is Editor mode and `play/` is Play mode. Shared types are in
`apps/shared/godot.ts`.

Godot is never drawn by the webview. It is a native process Veistra starts, watches and stops,
and Play places the game's window over its pane (owner decision 6 and spec section 11 replace
`VEISTRA-UX-REWORK.md` section 3.1's "never embedded"; the editor joins it there with C1).

## Section 9.2, decided: a native run

Play runs `godot --path <project>` as a child process of the environment. The game opens in its
own window and the pane shows what Veistra can honestly know about it: state, an stdout/stderr
log with errors and warnings highlighted, and pause, restart and stop.

The alternative was a web export shown in the pane. It was rejected because it needs an export
template and a build step before the first frame, changes what the game is (WebGL, no threads,
no native extensions), and would make "Play" mean a different program from the one that ships.
A native run needs nothing but the engine, and what it shows is what the player gets.

Cost: the frame is not in the pane. That is what Capture was for, until the game moved into
the pane: see "The game in the pane", below.

## Finding the engine

`detect.rs`. An explicit `godot.executablePath` setting is authoritative: a bad value is
reported, never silently replaced by another install. With no setting, the order is the
`GODOT4`/`GODOT` variables, `PATH`, common install folders, then Steam libraries. The first
that answers `--version` with a 4.x wins. On Windows the `_console.exe` sibling is preferred
for runs, because the GUI-subsystem exe writes nothing to a pipe. A found engine is remembered
until the setting changes or the pane asks to check again; a failed search is never cached.

Projects are `project.godot` files at or below the environment root (four folders deep,
skipping `.git`, `.godot`, `node_modules`, `.veistra`, `addons`). With several, the pane offers a
picker. A `config_version` of 4 or less is Godot 3 and is refused with a message.

## The run

`runner.rs`. One run per cluster. stdout and stderr are read on their own threads into a
bounded log (4000 lines, oldest dropped, drops counted). Lines are classified from the prefixes
Godot prints (`ERROR:`, `SCRIPT ERROR:`, `WARNING:`), and indented `at:` lines inherit the level
of the line they follow. The pane polls `play/state` with a cursor every 500 ms.

Stop kills the whole tree: `taskkill /T /F` on Windows, the process group on Unix, so the game
window and anything it spawned go with it. `RunEvent::Exit` calls `Godot::shutdown`, so no game
outlives Veistra. `Stopped` (asked for) and `Exited { code }` (the game ended) are different
states.

## Capture & comment, and pause

Godot has no external "give me a frame" interface, so a real screenshot needs code inside the
game. That is the capture addon: one GDScript autoload, opt in per project, consent-gated,
removable.

- Enable adds `addons/veistra/veistra_capture.gd` and one `[autoload]` line to `project.godot`.
  Disable removes exactly those, leaving anything else in `addons/veistra/` alone.
- The channel is a folder in the OS temp directory, passed as `-- --veistra-dir=<dir>`. Veistra
  writes `cmd.json` (atomically), the script answers `res-<id>.json`. No socket, no listener,
  no network. A reply may not name a file outside its own folder.
- Without the addon, Capture and Pause are disabled and say why. Nothing is faked.

## The game in the pane, takes, notes (design v0.1, 2026-10-30)

The "Play, Scene and Blender views" design (canvas "Veistra — Play, Scene and Blender views")
moves the game into the pane, records runs as takes, and closes the loop with an agent. The
native run above still holds: the game is its own process, and a crash in it never takes
Veistra down.

**The game in the pane** (`src-tauri/src/embed/`, Windows). After spawn, the game's window is
found by process (the game and its children, since `_console.exe` starts the real executable;
the `Engine` class first, never a console or a message box), its caption and borders removed,
`WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` set, made owned by the Veistra window, and its input queue detached from
Veistra's so a hung game cannot stall Veistra. The pane sends `play/embed-rect` with its game box
in window CSS pixels; Rust adds the window's client origin and scale, and a worker applies only
the newest box. The game is launched with `--windowed --resolution <pane size> --position <the
pane on screen>` so it first shows where the pane is. One registry (`embed/host.rs`) holds every
placed window, game, Godot editor or Blender, by the pane instance that shows it: it hides a
window whenever that pane is not the active tab of a cluster on screen (from the shell state)
and moves them all with the Veistra window. With no embedder (macOS, Linux), no window within
10 s, a refused style change (an elevated game) or a failed first move, the game keeps or gets
back its own decorated window, on screen over the pane, and the live strip says "Playing in its
own window" and why; `VEISTRA_EMBED=off` forces that path. A game whose Play pane closes is
stopped, its take saved first. An editor is never killed: it is handed back as a normal window
when its pane closes and at exit.

**Airspace.** The placed window paints above the WebView. The shell reports its open overlays
(menus, popovers, dialogs and the scrims behind modal sheets, the palette, toasts, the drag
ghost and where a dragged tab would drop, and a takeover or expanded page that covers the whole
tool window) as `veistra/overlays` (`src/shell/overlayWatch.ts`) to every app that declares
`places_window`. The pane (`apps/shared/useNativeBox.ts`) hides the window and shows its last
frame while one covers the box: the recording's while a take records, else a Graphics Capture of
the window itself (`embed/capture.rs`, only where Windows can leave out its yellow border), else
the capture addon's.

**Takes** (`record.rs`, `takes.rs`, `session.rs`). Record is per project, per computer, off by
default, and needs addon v2 and Windows. A take is `.veistra/takes/<utc minute>-<4 hex>/` with
`take.mp4`, `telemetry.jsonl`, `log.jsonl`, `take.json` and `notes.json`; the last ten are kept,
plus any with drafts, and `.git/info/exclude` keeps them out of git. On read-only main they go
under the app's data instead. Time zero is the first video frame's wall-clock time; telemetry
and the log carry wall time, so every lane lines up on one clock.

**Addon v2** writes a tick ten times a second (scene, camera, player, frame time, viewport,
tracked node boxes), marks for F8, and keys F7 and Ctrl Shift M, which it handles so the game
never sees them. `pick` casts a ray through a point. The marker is `# veistra-capture v2`, so a
project holding v1 shows "Update capture".

**Send** (`feedback.rs`) writes `.veistra/feedback/<take>-<n>/` with `packet.md` and per note
`markup.png`, `markup.json`, `contact.png`, `frames/` and `context.json`, files each note as a
comment with a `take` anchor, and the page attaches `packet.md` at the agent's prompt. Agents
use `list_play_notes`, `start_play_note` and `resolve_play_note` on the workspace server, or
on the context server from an agent tab.

### Decisions

| Decision | Chosen | Why, and what was rejected |
|---|---|---|
| R1 child window or R2 owned popup | R2, pending the Day 1 spike | Graphics Capture records the game window alone, never Veistra's UI. R1 (`SetParent`) is not built; the spike is where `CreateForWindow` on a child window gets tried. |
| One Godot app or two (#313) | One app, two modes: Editor · Play (owner decision 1) | Play's UI moved into `apps/godot-viewer/ui/src/play/`, and one Rust entry answers both modes. The two apps that switched with `veistra/open` were rejected by the owner: a pane is the Godot app, and the mode is what it shows. |
| Record default | Off | Takes cost disk (open decision 2's recommendation). |
| Tracked nodes | The design's default | `veistra_track` when it has members, else bodies and visible meshes in view, nearest 64. |
| Video clip in the packet | Not built | The agent reads the contact sheet; the checkbox is shown disabled with why. |
| Retention | Ten takes | Open decision 7. |
| Video size | The window's, not 720p | `windows-capture` crops or pads, it does not scale. The bitrate is fixed at 3.5 Mbit/s, under 60 MB for two minutes. A D3D11 scaling pass is the follow-up. |
| One embedder for the game, the Godot editor and Blender (#309) | `crate::embed`, a registry keyed by pane instance and kind; the game belongs to the Play pane that last sent `visible: true` | Keying by cluster or app id was rejected: a cluster can hold an editor and a game, Play can be open in two panes, and `play` becomes a mode of the Godot app (#313). The embed living inside Play's run gave the editors nothing to call. |
| Which apps get window rects and overlays (#309) | A `places_window` capability on the registry entry: projects, play, godot-viewer, blender-viewer | The hard-coded `{projects, play}` lists in `ToolWindow.tsx` would have hidden the game once Play moves into `godot-viewer`. A plugin surface never gets it. |
| Overlay signal (#309) | `veistra/overlays` with the overlays' rects, to frames; the `veistra:overlay-open/close` DOM events kept in the shell document | The spec's DOM events (§4.3.2) cannot reach a cross-origin frame, and a flag cannot tell a menu over the box from one across the window. Modal scrims and tab drop targets count, so a game in a pane the sheet does not reach steps aside too. |
| Method names (#309) | `play/embed-rect` (the spec's `play/embed_rect`); `embed/rect`, `embed/still`, `embed/pop-out`, `embed/dock`, `embed/state` with a `kind` for the editors | Every app method here is kebab-case. The game keeps methods of its own because Pop out finishes a take and Dock starts one. |
| The fallback (#309) | Launch at the pane's screen rect; on any failure a decorated window on screen over the pane, a cause code beside the reason; a window that shows after the 10 s wait is brought on screen, not placed | `--position -32000,-32000` left every fallback off screen, which is not "in its own window". `VEISTRA_EMBED=off` lets spec test 9 run where embedding works. |
| Editors when their pane closes and at exit (#309) | Handed back as a normal decorated window, never killed; the game keeps its rule (stopped, take saved) | Killing an editor loses unsaved work. A game left running hidden after its pane closed plays audio nobody can stop. |
| A still without a recording or the addon (#309) | Graphics Capture of the placed window, a frame kept every 500 ms, only where Windows can leave out the border; order recorder, capture, addon | Record is off by default and the addon is opt-in, so a plain run, and an editor always, had no still. A permanent yellow border on older Windows 10 is worse than an empty box. |
| `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` on a placed window (#309) | Kept | `windows-capture` 2.0.1 skips tool windows only in `Window::enumerate` (`is_valid`); the recorder and the still build the item from the handle (`from_raw_hwnd`, then `CreateForWindow`), which does not check. To confirm in the spike run. |
| Input queues under R2 (#309) | Detached once the window is owned (`AttachThreadInput(.., FALSE)`), as Godot's own embedding does | The owner link joins the two queues, so a hung game or a long editor import would stall Veistra's focus changes. |
| Where play_embedded and play_embed_failed fire (#309) | Rust, once per run when the outcome settles, through `telemetry::track`: `{ms}` or `{cause}`; nothing for a game that closed first, or for Pop out. A run with no pane open settles when a pane first places it | The page sees the outcome only while a Play pane polls, so an agent's run would go uncounted. Counting "no pane" as a failure was rejected: nothing was tried, and agents' runs would swamp the failure rate. The shell forwards these once #311's `features/godot.ts` and `backendTrack.ts` are in. |
| The `play` id (#313) | An alias in the registry: it serves the Godot app with `?mode=play`, shares its dispatch, keeps its own title and is left out of the Apps menu | Saved layouts, the Godot starting layout, presets, and agents' `veistra/open` and `app_call` name `play`, so deleting it would break them. An initial message to pick the mode was rejected: the bridge drops an event nobody listens for yet, and the mode must be known at first paint. |
| Mode names and Editor before C1 (#313) | Editor · Play; `?mode=scene` still means Editor. Until C1, Editor is the read-only scene view, with one line saying the editor opens in its own window | The spec names the modes Editor · Play. C1 replaces Editor's content with the embedded editor, and C3 keeps the scene view as its fallback, so the view stays where it is. |
| Which mode a pane opens in (#313) | The URL's first, then the pane's own choice, saved per pane instance in `localStorage` | A cluster switch unloads every frame and loads it afresh, and a Play pane must come back in Play over its game. Every Godot frame shares one origin, hence the instance in the key; with no instance nothing is kept. |
| What the mode shell holds (#313) | The window rect, the overlays and an open's payload, caught from the first moment; the Godot status; Play's project and the live notes | The modes load lazily, the bridge keeps no event nobody listened for, and the shell sends an unchanged window rect only once, so a mode loaded later would never hear where it is. |
| The status after a project move (#313) | Read again on every `project:changed`, and each mode reads what it took from the old root again | Read once at mount, the read-only banner and flag stayed on the main checkout's answer after the cluster moved to a worktree, which is where the banner sends people. |
| Rec's disabled state (#313) | Off and blocked, Record is disabled with the reason as its title, and Ctrl R does nothing; on and blocked it stays clickable to turn Record off | §5.1 asks for a disabled state. Off and blocked opened the capture consent; Enable capture stays in the footer, where it always was, and the strip says why. |
| Slot 5 (#313) | Pop out alone, always there, disabled with a reason when there is no game in the pane; Open in Godot is Editor's | A button that comes and goes shifts the toolbar as a run starts. Ctrl Shift O still opens the editor from Play until C1 embeds it. |
| Slot 2 in Play (#313) | The project picker when there are several, then a scene picker from `godot-viewer/state`, the main scene first, disabled while running | There was no way to choose what F5 runs, though `play/run` takes a scene. Restart keeps the running scene, so a pick while running would not be honoured. |
| The drawer's counts (#313) | Output counts every line; Errors counts what its tab lists, warnings with errors; the strip counts errors only | The Errors count was errors only while its tab listed warnings too. The strip says "errors", and counts those. |
| Reload keys (#313) | F5 and Ctrl R are kept from WebView2 inside the Godot app, Shift F5 too; F5 in Editor turns to Play and runs, as Godot's Run Project does; each mode's root takes the focus back when it falls to the page | WebView2's reload unloads the pane and, in Play, the game's place in it. Ctrl R typed into a note reached the page. A focused button that left with its view dropped the focus where F5 is the reload. |
| Comment pushes and the mark telemetry (#313) | Not wired here; #314 does both | The issue moves Play; the comment push (`useCommentsChanged`) and `mark_dropped` belong to review and its notes. |
| A game an agent started with no Play pane open (#309) | Its own window until a Play pane shows it; that pane places it when the window appears, or docks it at once if it is already up | Failing the pane's first box because the window had not shown yet left the game in its own frame for the whole run. The 10 s wait restarts when the pane opens: time with no pane had nothing to place the window in, and counting it kept a slow window out of a pane opened at 15 s while one opened at 25 s docked it. |

### Not verified on a real machine

Built and tested on Linux with unit tests and a Windows type-check; the Win32 embedder, the
recorder and the GDScript have not run. The acceptance list in section 13 of the design needs
a Windows 11 pass on the demo game and on Anomaly.

From #309, unit-tested through a fake window system and type-checked for Windows only:

- Spec test 1: the demo game and Anomaly in the pane with no title bar and no taskbar button;
  Pop out brings both back and Dock removes them. After a splitter drag or a maximise the window
  matches the box within 50 ms: `lastPlaceMs` in `pnpm probe --agent shell_snapshot`'s `embeds`.
- Moving Veistra, a monitor of another scale and 125% View zoom keep the window on the box.
- Spec test 2: a menu, the Ctrl K palette and its scrim, a dialog, a toast and a dragged tab
  over the box show the still, and the game never paints over them. The Graphics Capture still
  has no yellow border on Windows 11 and is the frame from just before the hide.
- Spec test 9: with `VEISTRA_EMBED=off`, and with an elevated game whose style change UIPI
  refuses, the game opens decorated on screen over the pane and the strip says "Playing in its
  own window". A window that first shows after 10 s ends up on screen.
- A hung game (a GDScript infinite loop) does not freeze Veistra's UI.
- The window classes `Engine` (Godot 4, game and editor) and `GHOST_WindowClass` (Blender).
- The real-window test in `embed/win32.rs`, which runs on CI's `windows-latest` only.
- `godot:play_embedded` and `godot:play_embed_failed` reaching PostHog.

From #313, tested in jsdom and type-checked for Windows only; no WebView2 or Godot ran:

- The layout against the board at 1440 × 900 and at 1024 px wide: the five slots on one row,
  the pickers giving way, the strip and drawer under the box, nothing of Veistra's inside it.
  jsdom does no layout; only the CSS declarations are checked (`narrow.css.test.ts`).
- F5, Shift F5, F6, F7, F8, Ctrl R and Ctrl Shift M with the pane focused in WebView2, and that
  F5, Shift F5 and Ctrl R never reload the pane, in either mode. The focus returning to the
  mode's root after Back to live or a mode switch was tested with `document.hasFocus` stubbed,
  since jsdom forgets it when the focused element goes.
- Switching a pane with an embedded game to Editor hides the game, and back to Play shows it in
  the box; the scene picker's native dropdown hides the game while it is open.
- A Play pane reloaded by a cluster switch comes back in Play, and an Editor pane in Editor
  (`localStorage` per origin in WebView2).
- The read-only banner going when the title bar's switcher or `set_project` moves the cluster
  from the main checkout to a worktree.

## The Godot Viewer

`scene.rs`. Refresh runs `godot --headless --path P -s dump_scene.gd -- --out F --scene S`,
which instantiates the scene without adding it to the tree and writes its nodes as JSON.
`--import` runs first when the project has no `.godot/` cache. The result is cached, stamped,
and shown with its age; nothing runs until someone presses Refresh.

If Godot is missing or the run fails, the tree is parsed from the `.tscn` text instead and the
pane says so ("Read from the scene file - Godot did not run", with the reason). Instanced
scenes take their type from the scene they instance, to a depth of four.

Render view is a separate, explicit action: Godot's Movie Maker mode for one frame, keeping the
last frame written. It is not headless, since a headless run has no renderer, so a Godot window
appears briefly. The frame is cached beside the tree and stamped separately.

## Read-only main (#163)

Running and viewing read the project, so they work on main. Writing does not:
`godot/open-editor`, `play/addon-install`, `play/addon-remove`, `play/send` and
`comments/verdict` are in `WRITE_METHODS` and are refused on main before a handler runs. The viewer's cache goes under the app-local data folder
for main and under `<env>/.veistra/godot-viewer/` for a worktree; run channels are always in temp.

What Veistra cannot prevent: Godot writes `<project>/.godot/` (import cache) whenever it loads a
project. It is engine-generated and gitignored by every Godot template.

## The 3D preview and markup

The Godot Viewer's "3D" tab shows the scene as an orbitable glTF instead of one still frame. It
needs Godot, like the tree does; "Render" is the still frame, and it is what the viewer falls back
to, with the reason, when the export fails.

**Export.** `godot/preview-glb` (params: `scene`, `actor`, optional `force`) runs
`export_glb.gd` headless (`GLTFDocument.append_from_scene`) and answers `ready`, `running` or
`failed`. The file is `<project>/.veistra/preview/godot/<scene-slug>.glb`, one per scene, replaced in
place through a temp file and rename. A `.json` beside it holds the cache key and the node map. The
key hashes the Godot version, the scene, every text scene or resource it references (by content)
and binary assets (by size and modified time), so an unchanged scene answers `ready` without
running Godot. Failures are remembered until `force`. On read-only main the file goes under the
app cache instead of `.veistra`. `actor` must be `human` or `agent`; `system` is refused.
`godot/preview-glb-bytes` hands the file to the viewer (48 MB cap).

**Node paths.** three.js renames nodes it loads (spaces become `_`, and `[ ] . : /` are dropped)
and Godot renames duplicates on export (`Crate2`). The reply's `nodeMap` maps each three.js-side
path to the Godot scene path (`Main/Crate/Crate`), so a pin's `nodePath` in the JSON below is a
Godot path.

**Mark up.** "Mark up" opens the markup layer over the 3D view (Excalidraw loads on first use, so
neither it nor three.js is in the viewer's first chunk). Arrows and boxes snap to nodes, and pins
carry the picked node. Done shows the result with "Send to agent". Sending stores two items, both
overwritten on the next send for that scene: the PNG under `godot/<scene>/markup` and the JSON
under `godot/<scene>/markup-json` (kind text, because the store caps images at 8 MB and text at
256 KB). If the JSON would exceed the cap the raw `excalidraw.elements` are dropped and
`excalidrawOmitted: true` is set; pins and annotations are always kept. Moving the camera during
markup discards it, since the drawing belongs to one view.

The JSON an agent receives is the format in `docs/markup-format.md`, with the source recorded as:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": { "kind": "scene", "glb": ".veistra/preview/godot/main_tscn.glb",
              "engine": "godot", "scene": "res://main.tscn", "godot": "4.7.2" },
  "camera": { "position": [4, 3, 5], "target": [0, 1, 0], "up": [0, 1, 0], "fov": 50 },
  "size": { "width": 640, "height": 360 },
  "pins": [{ "n": 1, "note": "too tall", "nodePath": "Main/Crate", "worldPoint": [1, 0.5, 0] }],
  "annotations": []
}
```
